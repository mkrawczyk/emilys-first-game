# Emily's First Game

This is a father/daughter project to learn the Godot engine and make something fun in the process. It's about Bunnsalot, a rabbit trying to save earth, air, water, and fire realms from the Lizgards.

* Code by Matt and Emily.

## About Emily

Iâ€™m ten years old. I like the color sky blue, rabbits, and beagles. I want to make a video game because I like playing video games and I want to make a game that has my interests, so mostly animals. I also like sports. I play soccer, softball, and basketball.

## About Matt

I'm much older than ten. I've been a software engineer for ~25 years, primarily in the backend space for web apps and API development, but got my start with programming by learning C in the mid-90s after spending all of my free time modding Doom 2 on a Windows 3.1 PC. Like I said, _much_ older than ten. You can find my name in the credits of BioShock Infinite, and now I'm looking forward to sharing that experience with my daughter.
